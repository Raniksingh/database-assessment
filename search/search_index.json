Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.</p> <p>Reports should be directed to Cody Fincher codyfincher@google.com &amp; Eri Santos erisantos@google.com, the Project Steward(s) for Database Migration Assessment framework. It is the Project Steward\u2019s duty to receive and address reported violations of the code of conduct. They will then work with a committee consisting of representatives from the Open Source Programs Office and the Google Open Source Strategy team. If for any reason you are uncomfortable reaching out to the Project Steward, please email opensource@google.com.</p> <p>We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused.
